## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Features I added

- **Real-time Email Validation**: I implemented a feature that provides instant validation feedback as the user types their email. This enhancement helps users correct mistakes before submitting the form.

### What I Learned & Useful Resources

In this project, I gained experience in handling form validation in React, working with state, and improving accessibility.

#### Useful Resources:

- [React - State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- [React - Hooks at a Glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
- [React - Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
- [React Hooks Cheat Sheet](https://react-hooks-cheatsheet.com/)
- [MDN - Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)

### Continued development

I plan to:

- Enhance skills in managing different states with React
- Explore more about React hooks
- Understand the lifecycle of components
- Ensure smooth user experience across different devices
